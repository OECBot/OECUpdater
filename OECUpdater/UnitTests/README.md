### Creating the Tests:
- Create a new class xxxUnitTests.cs
- Make sure you have the right dependencies
- Add using NUnit.Framework to your class
- [Familiarize yourself with the NUnit API](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki)
- Look at the sample project for reference/ideas - [Link](https://github.com/nunit/nunit-csharp-samples/blob/master/)
- Create required unit tests for components

### Running the Tests:
- Run tests with NUnit Console Runner (Can be found in .\team06-Project\OECUpdater\packages\NUnit.ConsoleRunner.3.5.0\tools)
  - YOU MUST USE TERMINAL(OR CMD IN WINDOWS) TO RUN IT!
  - Syntax(For windows only) = nunit3-console [input assembly location]
    - The assemblies should be located in the debug folder of the UnitTests project
  - Additional information can be found here: [Wiki](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Console-Command-Line)
