CSCC01 Deliverable 4 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

Total: 61/100

Project Management:  __________ (13/20%)

  Release plan:
    - each release corresponds to end of Sprint
    - project fully laid out:
      for each release date, list of user stories to implement
    - project velocity specified and used
    - highest priority user stories first modulo dependencies
    - reasonable goals for each release

[comments]
- good

  Product Backlog:
    - user stories follow the correct format.
    - user stories, together, reflect all the user requirements (from
      all personas).
    - user stories correspond to actual requirements (no "invented"
      features).
    - user stories contain enough information for devs to estimate how
      long it would take to implement it.
    - each user story addresses one specific requirement (no "world
      peace" stories).

[comments]
- good

  Sprint Backlog(s):
     - user stories taken from the Product Backlog
     - estimated costs
     - estimated values

[comments]
- good

  Sprint Plan(s):
    - user stories divided into tasks when appropriate.
    - each Sprint Plan contains all the necessary information:
        who is working on which task on which day
    - sum of costs of user stories in the sprint = project velocity
    - good planning decisions

[comments]
- good

[comments]
- good

  Use of Burndown Charts:
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided
    - correctness of burndown charts

[comments]
- snapshots at the beginning are missing (-2)

      (including good use of branching from now on!)

[comments]
- libraries and packages are pushed to the repo (-5)

  Use of communication tools:

[comments]
- good

Design and Implementation:  __________ (15/30%)

   System Design:
      - good modular design

[comments]
- very low priority features have been implemented first
- the most important features have yet to be implemented (-10)

Verification and Validation:  __________ (16/25%)

     - quality of unit tests:
         - good coverage
	 - no redundancy
     - code review activities and outcomes:
         - each review follows a checklist (not necessarily the example one, but the same checklist for all)
	 - each review is thorough
	 - evidence of addressing the outcomes of the review
	 - the video demonstrates an effective process used for the review/collection meeting
     - validation activities and outcomes:
          - evidence of feedback from the user
	  - evidence of addressing feedback from the user

[comments]
- the code review strategy and method is not explained (-2)
- good code execution
- no recommendations made to the team (-2)
- testing strategy is documented
- testing is very shallow. Only few unit tests. (-5)

Report: __________ (13/15%)

  - well-presented, is easy to read and to navigate
  - spelling and grammar
  - looks professional
  - quality of the README file

[comments]
- Task board snapshots are unreadable (-2)

Interview: ________ (4/10%)

[comments]

All members present and on time: yes

1) Team Members' Roles [2/2]:

- One person keeps track of deadlines
- ... is the meeting manager
- ... takes care of the burndown chart, sprint plan and so on
- .. manages the master branch
- ... proofread deliverables

Good.

2) Checkout, build, run [0/2]:

- not able to run outside of the dev env
- not able to run it inside dev env neither

3) Demo [0/2]:

- demo makes no sense
- the only thing that work is authentication and setting up a timer. These features should have been low priority.

4) Project Management [0/2]:

-  Nothing happen for sprint 3 and 4 and there was no action taken at the beginning of sprint 5

5) Code reviews [2/2]:

- good
