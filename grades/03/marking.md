CSCC01 Deliverable 3 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

Total: 68/100

Project Management:  __________ (36/40%)

  Release plan:
    - each release corresponds to end of Sprint
    - project fully laid out:
      for each release date, list of user stories to implement
    - project velocity specified and used
    - highest priority user stories first modulo dependencies
    - reasonable goals for each release

[Score: 3/5]
- dates are missing (-2)

  Product Backlog:
    - user stories follow the correct format.
    - user stories, together, reflect all the user requirements (from
      all personas).
    - user stories correspond to actual requirements (no "invented"
      features).
    - user stories contain enough information for devs to estimate how
      long it would take to implement it.
    - each user story addresses one specific requirement (no "world
      peace" stories).

[Score: 5/5]
- good

  Sprint Backlog(s):
     - user stories taken from the Product Backlog
     - estimated costs
     - estimated values

[Score: 5/5]
- good

  Sprint Plan(s):
    - user stories divided into tasks when appropriate.
    - each Sprint Plan contains all the necessary information:
        who is working on which task on which day
    - sum of costs of user stories in the sprint = project velocity
    - good planning decisions

[Score: 5/5]
- good

  Use of Task Board:
    - correct format of task boards
    - snapshots in the beginning and end of each Sprint are provided

[Score: 5/5]
- image quality is too low but ok, I cannot read the content of the cards (see below)

  Use of Burndown Charts:
    - snapshots in the begginning and end of each Sprint are provided
    - correctness of burndown charts

[Score: 5/5]
- image quality is too low (see below)

  Use of Repo:
    (good use of branches not required here, but is required for next deliverable)

[Score: 3/5]
- third-party libraries, binaries and generated files should not be in the repo (-2)

  Use of communication tools:
     - evidence of using communication tools of their choice effectively

[Score: 5/5]
- good

Design and Implementation:  __________ (8/30%)

   System Design:
      - good modular design
      - general and easy to extend
      - it is clear how the current implementation is going to be
        extended into an application that satisfies the client's needs

[Score: 5/10]
- Very shallow design: abstract description of modules with ad-hoc system components diagram (-5)

   Implementation:
     - 0 marks if it doesn't run
     - at least one feature is either fully implemented of nearly implemented
     - quality and maturity of code

[Score: 3/20]
- No instructions to run the code (-2)
- Mismatch between the code structure and the proposed design (-5)
- Mismatch between the code and the documentation: some user stories are marked as completed when they are actually not fully implemented (-10)

Report: __________ (16/20%)

  - well-presented, is easy to read and to navigate
  - spelling and grammar
  - looks professional
  - quality of the README file

[comments]
- good quality report
- snapshots are not readable (-2)
- README file not updated (-2)

Interview: ________ (6/10%)

[comments]

1) Changes to Product Backlog [2/2]:

4) Task Board and Burndown Chart [2/2]:

- good management
