2) Introduce the team members:        30/30

   I am assuming 5 members. If your team has four members,
   scale accordingly.

   for each member:
      approx 150 words: 1/1
      spelling and grammar: 1/1
      clarity: 1/1
      professionalism: 2/2

   The members' introductions are consistent w.r.t. person (in
   first/third person), style, qualities/interests described, etc., so
   that the overall introduction reads well:      5/5

3) Team agreement:     5/10

    methods of communication, including wait time for replies, clearly stated:  1/2
    meeting times arranged:  2/2
    contingency planning (member is sick, missing meetings, not performing up to standards, etc.):  1/2
    use of version control is discussed:  1/2
    some planning of individual roles:  1/2


==== Comments ====
- Document quality: the agreement is hand written (-1)
- Methods of communication are inefficient (-1)
- No details about the use of version control beyond "having meaningful log messages" (-1)
- Division of work is not addressed beyond "we will collectively decide on who work on what". (-1)
- No contingency plan beyond "we will divide the work equally between team members". (-1)
