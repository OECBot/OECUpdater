CSCC01 Deliverable 2 Marking Guide
-----------------------------------

Personas:  14 / 20

  Format: 4 / 4

      must contain: gender, age, personality, skills, environment,
      attitude towards technology in general, attitude towards
      computer software, goals when using the system

      Too many irrelevant details are not useful!

==== Comments ====
- good
==================

  Information content:  4 / 8

      The purpose of each persona is clear. Personas suggest different
      system requirements.

==== Comments ====
- The personas do not address the goals when using the system (-2)
- Personas #2 suggests different attitude towards software however it does not say anything about whether they are familiar with version control (git and github) (-2)
==================

  Coverage: 6 / 8

      personas must include at least two of the following type of users:

      -- "Hanno type"

      -- Hanno's grad student: can approve modifications to the data,
           but cannot add other such users (only Hanno can)

      -- A less tech-savvy astronomer: Sure, Hanno is the client who
           makes the order, but the software will be released as
           open-source, so other types of users are 100% realistic.

==== Comments ====
- You have not considered users's privileges (-2)
- You have not considered someone outside Hanno's team at UofT.
How about an astronomer living somewhere else in the world  that wants to contribute to the database but does not know how to use git and github?
====================

Product Backlog:  36 / 50

    10 / 10 : User stories follow the format
                "As __name__ (__role__), I want __something__."
		("so that __benefit__" is optional)
	       AND each __name__ corresponds to one of the personas.

    5 / 10 : User stories, together, reflect all the user
    	        requirements (from all prospective users).

    5 / 10 : User stories correspond to actual requirements (no
    	        "invented" features).

    8 / 10 : User stories contain enough information for devs to
                estimate how long it would take to implement it.

    8 / 10 : Each user story addresses one specific requirement (no
                "world peace" stories).

==== Comments ====
- The user stories for persona #2 are copy and paste from persona #1. There is no story specific to that persona (-5)
- You have not addressed the problem of conflicting update at all (-5)
- Some user stories are artificial (see comments) (-2)
- Some user stories are vague (see comments) (-2)
====================

Presentation:  19 / 20

  4 / 4 : well-presented, is easy to read and to navigate

  4 / 4 : spelling and grammar

  10 / 10 : looks professional

  1 / 2 : quality of the README file

==== Comments ====
README should be more explicit about what the deliverables contain (-1)
===================

Interview: 5 / 10

==== Comments ===

1) The process [2]:

Satisfying although there should be a lot more face-to-face meeting at this earlier stage of the project
- 3 times (no face-to-face meeting after the client's meeting)
- Most of the discussion took place online (Facebook chat)
- Facebook chat
- No TA feedback
- One person edited the document

2) Personas [2]:

Satisfying however the team should not stop at what the client wants but rather understand what the client needs.

3) Product Backlog [2]:

Not satisfying. The student was not able to explain the logic behind the user stories. (-2)

4) Details of User Stories [2]:

No satisfying, the explanation seemed very artificial. The student acknowledged that these stories were not verified to the client. (-2)

5) Sprint Backlog [2]:

No answer from the student however the rest of the team provided a satisfying answer. (-1)
